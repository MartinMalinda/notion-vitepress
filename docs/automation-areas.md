# Automation areas
  
## Project management üîç

There‚Äôs a lot of software for project management. Some are quite specific - for example JIRA is tailored towards software development, especially in combination with the AGILE methodology. But a lot of projects require unique project management needs. None of the specialized tools might be a great fit. In that case flexible tools such as Trello or Airtable can be used, together with custom integrations to best fulfil your custom project management needs.

### **Highlights**

- Create a canban board and figure out the stages of projects / features

- Notify key people when status of project or product features change

- Create weekly key reports about progress and post it to Slack or Email

- Always cross link to other relevant resources (Figma, Gitlab, Github etc)

- Create a roadmap (which can also be public)

## Finances üí∞

**Highlights**

- Client management

- Invoice generation, sending, organization

- MRR tracking

- Custom reports and dashboards for revenue, expenses, profit, MRR and so on

## Onboarding üë•

Being able to effectively inform and educate a newcomer to your company has lots of value. Good onboarding not only makes the newcomer productive sooner, but it also makes them feel welcome and leads to higher mutual respect - they feel respected to be given this much attention and care and they respect the company for being able to get things done.

Make sure the newcomer is invited into all the right tools, that they meet all the right people and learn all the right information. It‚Äôs important not to overwhelm them and chunk the information gradually over time.

### **Highlights**

- Central list of contractors / employees in Airtable

- Send a welcome email after addition

- Automatically create accounts in other services (via APIs)

- Welcome email should have a link to a starting point in documentation

- Manage a check list of meetings, reading / video resources, Notify relevant people as the onboarding progresses

- Automatically set up meetings or provide Calendly links at the right time

## Marketing üì£

Marketing is often a creative process and as such there‚Äôs not that much space to automate (leaving aside advanced AI) but oftentimes it‚Äôs still possible to come up with processes or some streams of data that can be used by marketers. Marketers need to be informed well about the activity of the company. Statistics, dashboards, digests all can make their job much easier.

And sometimes it‚Äôs possible to automate some parts of the marketing completely. Some statistics or other periodical information can be channeled to social networks automatically or with just minor edits and confirmation from a marketer (New blog posts, podcasts, product updates, financial reports, information digests and so on).

### **Highlights**

- Create a stream of data that might be announced on social media or elsewhere

- Manage these items in Airtable

- Generate images based on a template (Blog posts, Podcast episodes)

- Automatically share repetitive announcements (podcast episodes, blog posts)

- Create a custom dashboard with different growth of follower counts, most popular content etc.

## Hiring ü§ù

Finding the right candidates and putting the right people at the right places is crucial for the success of your company. The tools we work with allow us to create a professional hiring process. Track the status of different candidates. Create beautiful job postings, keep the candidates informed. Track the hiring processes over time and evaluate their effectiveness.

### **Highlights**

- Create a central table with positions in Airtable

- Create a custom view and form or feed the data to a hiring tool such as Greenhouse.io

- Feed applicants to Airtable, prioritize them, label them‚Ä¶

- Send notifications to Slack or Email

## Sales üí∞

Sales need leads - a feed of potential customers, clients, partners. These feeds can be created, filtered, enhanced by various tools. And different companies need different sale tools. Bigger companies might need a bigger CRM platforms like SaleForce or Pipedrive. Smaller companies can get away with a simpler solution, perhaps just a simple database table in Airtable.

### **Highlights**

- Use Airtable Web clipper to quickly add new contacts from the web

- Connect Clearbit or other services to enrich the contact data

- Feed data from Tiktok, Instagram, Facebook‚Ä¶

- Add Slack notificiation on certain status changes

- Notify key people via slack or email when relevant contacts are being added or when they‚Äôre changed

## Internal dashboards üìä

Most of the companies have results that can be tracked and quantified and presented internally or even externally. If people are well informed how the company is doing their better motivated and also empowered. Empowered to try new things, to think about the company more holistically and think outside the box. Seeing the impact of your work is important to prevent burnout. Being given credit, being recognized internally for your work is also crucial.

Internal processes can make sure that work results will get noticed and appreciated.

## Feedback collection üìà

As humans we need both positive and negative feedback. We need positive feedback, to stay motivated, to know we‚Äôre doing the right thing. We also need the constructive negative feedback so that we can identify our weak spots, evolve and grow.

Feedback collection can be automated as a core process of the company. Feedback can be collected from clients, partners or even from company members themselves.

If there‚Äôs clients or customers that are grateful, this gratitude should flow to the right people that made it happen!

A company that has a steady source of positive feedback can maintain a healthy work culture. Having money or social status as the only source of motivation is tricky and can lead to corruption or burnout.

## Analytics üî¢

Chances are you‚Äôre using some kind of analytics in your product. We can plug these data into custom dashboards or even create periodical digests to databases like Airtable, to create custom reports specific to your company needs.
