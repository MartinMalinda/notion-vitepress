# Tools
  
I like to pick and set up tools that are lightweight and yet flexible and can be integrated with one another. With the following toolset I can cover a lot of usecases and create a custom tailored solution that is also reasonably easy to understand and maintain.

### [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

A place for managing freeform textual information. A great entry point for anyone learning about your company, its philosophy, processes and other tools.

### [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)

An accessible relational database. Any information that comes in collection well fits into Airtable. Form submissions, tables of data such as clients, contacts, projects, tasks but also competitor monitoring and multitude of other things.

### [Slack](https://slack.com/)

Real time communication and notification. A great tool to stay up to date as information is changing and incoming during the day. Slack can be used if it’s important to react quickly to incoming information. Slack can also integrate custom chat bots and thus it can end up being a centralised command line / user interface for diverse tasks executed in various other products.

### [Google Suite](https://workspace.google.com/business/)

Email is still part of every day communication. Email motivates towards thoughtful communication as opposed to stream of consciousness communication that often happens over Slack or other real time chats. Email is still often the way to do outreach. Google Suite also offers Drive for file storage and also Docs, Spreadsheets which also still have their place. There’s possibility for integrations for most of Google products.

### [**Zapier**](https://zapier.com/)

To bring integrations to a whole new level, Zapier can be used. It works as a glue between different programmable tools. If product A and B cannot be integrated directly, it can often be done through a middleman, such as Zapier.

Zapier allows us to realise the more ambitious requests

### Code

We’re not shying away from code. If there’s a need for truly a unique solution we can create a more ambitious integration via code hosted on a public server. The downside of this solution is that maintenance (and evolution) of this solution requires expertise, which goes against our philosophy that anyone can over time automate by themselves. But maybe your company has software engineers and then this is a perfect match. Or we can maintain the code for you.

### [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/)

In order to think about your company business model and to visualise important patterns we draw diagrams. To these diagrams we can further insert schemes for automation. This visual thinking helps us, but it can also be a point of reference for you. If you find FigJam to be useful, we can also come up with a custom workshop.

### [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

A productivity application for MacOS which boosts your efficiency with hotkeys, keywords and text expansion. Custom Alfred workflows can make every day tasks easier. There can be shortcuts for specific websites, quick accesses for lists of data or even shortcuts to open specific files in specific programs.

### [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac/intro-to-shortcuts-apdf22b0444c/mac)

Shortcuts on MacOS and iOS are sometimes a good alternative to Alfred workflows. The benefit is they can be used both on Mac and on Mobile (iOS). They can be viable for more simple flows such as specific bookmarks and quick submissions of data.
