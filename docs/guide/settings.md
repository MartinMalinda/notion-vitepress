# Functions and settings

## Audio and video player

You can upload content directly to Herohero, without having to worry about the size or length of the format. Our player works with all desktop and mobile devices and even allows users to play content with a locked screen. In this respect Herohero is ideal for all audio and video creators.

## Pictures

You can upload pictures in their full size. Thanks to the simple and minimalistic design, the pictures stand out beautifully. Herohero is ideal for photographers.

## Text

Text can be displayed standardly, in cursive or bold. You can also add links and emoticons.

## Comments

Comments are ideal for communication between creators and their fans. They work as a space to give feedback or ask any questions.

## Messages

Messages, similarly to comments, are used as a communication tool between creators and their fans. The message section, due to its intimate environment, is more suitable for private conversations.

## Invites

Every creator can invite anyone they want to their profile, without the person having to pay a subscription fee. Our invites were created exactly for this purpose. Click on the arrow icon in the top right corner of the screen, copy the unique link and send it to the person you want to have access to your profile.
