## When will I receive my payment?

Herohero uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ "Stripe") for all its transactions. After successfully connecting the Herohero profile to Stripe and receiving at least one subscriber, creators are able to receive payments. Payments are sent out on the first workday of every month to the bank account that has been connected to Stripe.

## Can I create more than one type of subscription for one account?

On Herohero it is only possible to create one type of subscription. One price, for many users, is much more comprehensible and leads to more subscribers.

There is no fragmentation of fans into different groups – this helps creators build a more familiar, community-like experience for their fans where everyone is equal.

## Does Herohero have any restrictions?

No. The type of content you share is solely up to you (under the condition that it doesn’t break any laws that are valid in the Czech republic of course). Herohero also doesn’t limit the size or length of the uploaded content.

## Which media formats are supported?

We support a majority of media formats. If your desired format is not uploading, please let us know via e-mail [info@herohero.co](mailto:info@herohero.co).

## Is my data secure?

Your private data is safely stored on servers owned by [Google](https://cloud.google.com/ "Google"). We cherish your content, that’s why only paying subscribers are granted access to your content, eliminating the possibility of having any of it stolen.

## Tax

Everyone in the Czech republic that earns more than 15 000 CZK per year is obliged to pay taxes. If you are new to the process of paying taxes, we recommend visiting[ jakpodnikat.cz](http://jakpodnikat.cz/), where you can find a lot of helpful tips.

A tax invoice will be sent to your email with every payment you receive, which can be used as a statement of income. It comes with instructions for tax clearance.
