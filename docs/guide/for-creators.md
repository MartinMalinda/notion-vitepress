# For creators

## When will I receive my payment?

Salaries are sent to bank accounts on the first business day of each month.

## How much is herohero charging me?

Herohero is deducting only 10% from your income. This fee covers the payment gate, money transfer to your bank account, complete hosting and other fees.

## Can I create more than one type of subscription for one account?

Herohero offers one type of subscription with the option of changing the cost. For users the option of one tier is more comprehensible and ultimately leads to higher conversion rates. Due to this, there is no needless grouping between your subscribers, instead it helps build a community where everyone is treated the same way.

## What price do you set?

The amount of the monthly fee depends on the type and value of the content. The most common fee is between 4-6 EUR. If you are unsure about the price setting, contact [info@herohero.co](mailto:info@herohero.co)

## Does herohero have any restrictions?

No. The content you share is completely up to you, in alignment with active Czech laws of course. You will not find any limitations or restrictions even with the size and length of uploads.

## Which media formats are supported?

We support a majority of media formats. If your desired format is not uploading, please let us know.

## Is my data secure?

All private data is securely encrypted on Google servers. We prioritise our security so that the only people that have access to your content are your subscribers and that your content cannot be stolen in any way.

## Tax

Everyone whose annual income exceeds CZK 15,000 is obliged to file taxes. If you are starting to pay taxes, we recommend visiting the jakpodnikat.cz portal.

With each payment, you will receive a tax document by email, which you can use as your record and which also contains instructions for your accounting needs.
