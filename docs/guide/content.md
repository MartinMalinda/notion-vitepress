## Video & Audio

No. Video and audio uploaded to your channel can be accessed only by the paid subscribers.

### What video and audio formats are supported?

Wide majority of video and audio files are supported. If your file can't be selected in upload
or there is an error in the upload process, please let us know.

### Can the video or audio be played offline?

Due to security reasons we don't allow this feature so far.  
In the future the creator might allow this for their content.

### Does the player remember the last location?

Yes if you listen / watch on the same device as last time. In the future we want to make this work
across different devices.

### Can I access an audio podcast from HH in my podcast app?

Herohero would have to provide an RSS feed and so far it doesn't due to security reasons.  
In the future it might be opt-in by the creator.

### Can I change the thumbnail of the video?

At the moment it's not possible to upload a custom image as the thumbnail.
You can however pick any frame of the video and set it as the thumbnail.
Stop the video at the right time and click on the options at the top right corner of the video player
and select "Choose this frame as thumbnail" option.
