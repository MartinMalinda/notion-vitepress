# Payouts

After successful connection to Stripe and after having at least one paid subscriber on your channel you'll be ready to receive your first payout.  
Payouts are then sent on first business day of each month to the bank account connected to your Stripe account.

## The amount I received is different from the number I see on my subscribers page
The monthly profit that is visible on the subscribers page is avaraged from all the subscribers. Because people subscribe in various parts of the month and some people unsubscribe and other subscribe the actual number can slightly differ each month. You might receive a little bit less or more each month.
