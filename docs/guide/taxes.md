# Taxes

As you receive profit from your subscribers you might be required to pay taxes from it in your country.

After each payout we will send you an invoice to your email address which you can use for your tax evidence.

Because tax laws differ from country to country we cannot provide any specific guidance.

## VAT

**???**

If you or your company is required to pay VAT you can compute it and adjust the invoice. if you need any support, let us know.

Herohero does not allow charging VAT the end customer. We believe it is better not to confuse the customer with extra numbers and let them pay a simple fee.  
It is therefore your task, to subtract the VAT tax from the profit it and pay it accordingly.
