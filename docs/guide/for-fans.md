# For fans

## How to start?

1. Sign up using Google, Facebook or email.
2. Search for your favourite creator.
3. Buy the subscription of your selected creator. This will automatically unlock all of the creator's content.

## How to buy a subscription?

1. Click the Subscribe button on your chosen creator’s profile.
2. Choose a payment method (Google Pay, Apple Pay or card)
3. Et voilà, you have access to the content of your favourite creator.

## Why doesn't Herohero have a feed?

Herohero is designed in such a way so that it helps build a community and deepen the relationship between the creator and his fans. Showing content from multiple creators at a time goes against this concept.

## How can I cancel my subscription?

Go to your profile and click on the Subscriptions section. Then find the creator that you would like to unsubscribe, click on the button that shows the monthly fee. The last and final step is to confirm your decision by clicking on the Unsubscribe button.
