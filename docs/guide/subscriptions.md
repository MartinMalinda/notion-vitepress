# Subscriptions

## When can people start subscribing to my channel?

Only after you connect your Herohero account to Stripe. You can do it in the "payouts" section in the settings. Before that you can add posts on your wall but visitors will not be able to subscribe to you and see them.

## What are the invites?

On the invites page you can generate a magic link that can provide access to your channel to someone without paying for a subscription. This invitation is permanent and can't be undone.
You can invite people to your channel even before you connect your account to Stripe.

This magic link can be used just once - it expires once it is successfuly used and someone enteres your channel for free with it. But you can generate as many as you wish of them.

These invites can be useful if you want to invite your friends or close followers and they can also help you kickstart your community.

If you've been invited to a channel, when you got to a list of your subscriptions you will see "free" on the subscription button on the right side.

## Can I set up different tiers like on other platforms?

No. We think that the price for entry into the paid channel should be the same for everyone.

## Can I change the currency of my channel?

So far not, but it is planned.
