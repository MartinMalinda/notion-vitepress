# Payments

Payments on Herohero are powered by Stripe. Stripe makes payments fast and secure.

## What payment options are supported?

Through Stripe we accept Visa and Mastercard and we also allow payments via Google Pay and Apple pay on mobile devices.

## When do I get charged?

When you pay for a subscription your card is charged right away and the billing period starts. Then you'll get charged again at the end of a billing period after 28 - 31 days.

## How can I cancel my subscription?

On your profile go to your subscriptions, click the button on the right side and confirm cancelling the subscription. The subscription will be set to cancelled and will be removed at the end of the billing period. At any point you can revert this decision and renew the subscription.

## What happens if the card cannot be charged?

If for whatever reason we cannot charge your card or you have removed your card from your account, the subscription ends up in "past due" state for up to 14 days. During this period you can make sure that the payment processes and the subscription will be again fully active.

If you decide to cancel the subscription during the past due period we will not try to charge you again and the subscription is removed immediately.
