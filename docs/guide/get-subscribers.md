# How to get subscribers?

## What content should I share?

Share content that has a unique value. Fans will subscribe to your account if they understand that the content you share is truly interesting.

A lot of creators have found it useful to use bonus (premium) content as an extension to their public creations - an extended version of a podcast, a longer version of a Youtube video, etc.

## How to promote bonus content?

* If you create videos or podcasts, the most effective way of promoting your bonus content is at the start and end of the public version of your podcast/video (e.g. at the start: “Thank you to all of my Herohero subscribers. Your support is highly appreciated.” or at the end: “You can find the extended version on Herohero, the exclusive version contains…”)
* It is very important to let your subscribers know what they can expect from the exclusive version - your fans have to understand what content they’re paying for.
* Promoting your account on social media definitely helps. If you create content other than audio or video, promoting your Herohero profile on the internet is a must.

## How to set up the correct price?

The subscription fee that you set up depends on the type and value of your content. For instance: the subscription fee on Herohero is usually between 4-6 EUR. We recommend setting the fee up around 100 CZK (4-5 EUR) rather than 200 CZK (200 CZK could potentially be a high amount for a subscriber to pay).

Some creators also found it effective to start at a lower price (e.g. at 4 EUR) and later raise the price (to 5-6 EUR).

If you are having any difficulties with selecting a suitable price or have any questions, contact us at [info@herohero.co](mailto:info@herohero.co), we’ll be happy to help.
