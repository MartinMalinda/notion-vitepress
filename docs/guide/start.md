## Why doesn't herohero have an overview of all its creators?

Herohero values every community surrounding it's creators. That's why we think that fans shouldn't be given any unwanted distractions and only the desired content of individual users.

## Why doesn't herohero have a feed?

Herohero is designed in such a way that it helps create a community and deepens the relationship between creators and their fans. Mixing the content of different creators goes against this concept.

## Who's behind everything?

Herohero was created by the owners of GoOut, a culturally informative media and system for selling tickets.
