# First time on Herohero

## What is Herohero?

Herohero is a modern platform for creators and their fans.

## Who can create on Herohero?

It doesn't matter if you create videos, record podcasts, take photographs, write or even cook. On herohero you have full creative freedom to upload any type of content.

## Why was Herohero founded?

Creative work is a job like any other – we believe that every job deserves a reward. That’s why we created a platform with fair conditions, where creators can get financially rewarded directly from their fans.

## Why doesn't Herohero have an overview of all its creators?

We consider the idea of showing fans of individual creators other profiles – potential competition, undesirable.

## Who's behind everything?

Herohero was created by [GoOut](https://goout.net/en/) – a platform that is used to promote culture.
