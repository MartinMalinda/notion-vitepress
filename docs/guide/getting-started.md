# What is Herohero?

Herohero is a social network that appreciates creativity. On Herohero you can publish content and subscribe to content of others but here the content is monetized. This allows creators of all sorts to fund their interests and passions.  
Anyone on Herohero can create their own paid channel.

## How is Herohero different from other platforms?

Herohero aims to be useful and minimal. Visitors can subscribe to a paid channel with a few clicks and they are not bothered by setting up a password, confirming their email and so on. Creators can setup up their paid channel very fast with the help of Stripe. The platform supports DMs and secure well-integrated video and audio. Herohero has also just a 10% fixed fee so that most of the income goes to the creator.

## Who is Herohero for?

Anyone. We've found out that various creators can have success on Herohero. Podcasters, writers, fitness and wellness gurus, vloggers, musicians or whoever else who can provide extra value to their audience. In general, people tend to pay for quality content.

## Will Herohero advertise or in other way market my content?

Mostly no. The platform does not have a feed and does not suggest accounts to subscribe to. It is therefore primarily your task to bring your audience here. Herohero then provides a calm online place without distractions.

Sometimes we do however feature some creators on platforms like Instagram, Twitter or Facebook.

## How large audience do I need to have success on Herohero?

This is very hard to say in general. You can have thousand loyal followers (or super fans ;)) on a public social media platform which will happily follow you on Herohero. You can also have many thousands of followers but they won't see the added value and choose not to subscribe.
