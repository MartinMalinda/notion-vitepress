As you receive profit from your subscribers you might be required to pay taxes from it in your country.

After each payout we will send you an invoice to your email address which you can use for your tax evidence.

Because tax laws differ from country to country we cannot provide any specific guidance. **We recommend reaching out to a local tax advisor faimiliar with the laws of your country.**

## VAT

Herohero does not allow charging VAT the end customer. We believe it is better not to confuse the customer with extra numbers and let them pay a simple fee.  
If you're a VAT payer, it is therefore your task, to subtract the VAT tax from the profit and pay it accordingly.
