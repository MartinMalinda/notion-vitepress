# Připojení Stripe

Herohero uses Stripe for secure payments. Purchases of subscriptions are managed by the Stripe gateway. But Stripe is also used to issue payouts to the creators. By creating a Stripe account and linking it to Herohero, you'll allow Stripe to send your monthly profits to your bank account. It only takes a few minutes to set up.

## Getting started

By clicking the "Connect" button in the payout settings you'll be taken to Stripe.

On the stripe side you'll be asked for an email address, phone number and you might be required to upload a photo of your personal documents.  
This is needed so that Stripe can verify your identity and so the money transfers comply with the law.

Once your Stripe account is set up well and connected to Herohero successfully, you'll see a link to your Stripe account in the Payout settings:

After clicking on "My account", you'll be able to see the history of your payouts and your current balance. You can also manage your Stripe account, for example changing a target bank account, and your personal information.

## Common questions
### Stripe requires a website but I don't have one

You can fill there your social media account URL or even your Herohero channel URL. Whatever online space is representative of your business.

### I skipped some of the parts and the connection went through

Stripe may allow you to skip a few details but you might be required to fill them up later. If that happens Stripe will inform you of that by email. Please don't postpone that as not providing required information might lead to Stripe locking your account.
